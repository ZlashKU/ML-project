This project aims to discover clinically meaningful subgroups within an HCV dataset using clustering methods. 
The dataset includes multiple laboratory markers (e.g., ALT, AST, ALP, Bilirubin) and demographic features such as age and sex. 
Although a target column indicating known clinical labels (e.g., blood donors, hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis) is available, it is excluded during clustering to maintain the unsupervised nature of the analysis.
